									The police investigate a series of deaths related to people who all appear to have
									committed suicide by taking a poisonous pill. They turn to their unofficial
									consultant, Sherlock Holmes, who deduces various elements pointing to a serial
									killer. Meanwhile, Holmes is introduced to John Watson, a former soldier who served
									in Afghanistan, and the pair immediately move into a flat in Baker Street. John
									Watson slowly gets to know and trust Sherlock despite police officer Sally Donovan
									(Vinette Robinson) warning him that Holmes is a psychopath and will one day be
									responsible for murder. Sherlock's brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), at first not
									revealing his identity, arranges a meeting with Watson and asks whether he will spy
									on Sherlock for money, but John refuses. After a series of incidents, the person
									responsible for the deaths, a taxicab driver (Phil Davis), reveals that his victims
									took their own lives by playing a game of Russian roulette with two pills: one
									fatally poisonous, the other safe. Before Sherlock can play the cabbie's game, John
									shoots the cabbie from an opposite building. Before he dies, the taxicab driver
									reveals that "Moriarty" was his sponsor.

									Sherlock is hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in

									Sherlock and John follow a trail of clues that link the two dead men to a Chinese

									criminals, who believe that John is Sherlock. Sherlock rescues them, but the leader
									of the gang escapes. Later, the leader of the gang is in communication with her
									superior, who is identified by the initial "M". She is then shot by a sniper.

									Moriarty chooses to let Sherlock and John go after receiving a phone call. Some time
									later, Mycroft hires Sherlock and John to retrieve compromising photos of a minor
									royal, which are held on the camera phone of Irene Adler (Lara Pulver), a ruthless
									and brilliant dominatrix who also trades in classified information extracted from
									her rich and powerful clients. Sherlock obtains Adler's phone, but discovers it is
									booby-trapped and requires a code to disarm it. When Adler discovers that the CIA
									are on her trail, she disappears and is then apparently killed, only to reappear to
									ask John to get her camera phone back from Sherlock. Weeks later when the coast is
									clear, Adler tricks Sherlock into deciphering a coded message on her phone which she
									obtained from another well-connected client. She sends the message to Moriarty, who
									in turn uses it to foil a British counter-terror operation. She almost succeeds in
									blackmailing Mycroft, but Sherlock finally cracks the password for the phone,
									leaving Adler without the protection she needs to survive. The episode concludes as
									Mycroft tells John that she has been killed by a terrorist group in Pakistan, while
									in fact she was secretly rescued by Sherlock.

									Sherlock and John are contacted by Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), a man traumatised
									by the death of his father by a monstrous hound on Dartmoor years before.
									Investigating Dewer's Hollow, a local spot where the beast was allegedly seen, as
									well as the nearby Ministry of Defence testing site Baskerville, Sherlock and John
									uncover a conspiracy wherein one of the Baskerville scientists, Dr. Frankland (Clive
									Mantle), is continuing the work of H.O.U.N.D., an aborted project to create a
									hallucinogenic gas for military use. Sherlock and John discover that the legendary
									hound is an ordinary dog used for publicity that the hallucinogenic gas makes appear
									as a demonic monster. The "hound" that killed Henry's father was actually Frankland
									wearing a red-lensed gas mask and a T-shirt bearing the logo of the H.O.U.N.D.
									group. Confronting both the dog and Frankland at Dewer's Hollow, John and Lestrade
									shoot the dog. Frankland attempts to flee, but dies when he runs into a minefield.
									In the final scene, Mycroft releases a confined Jim Moriarty.

									Moriarty launches a simultaneous heist on the Tower of London, Bank of England, and
									Pentonville Prison, crimes for which he allows himself to be captured and put on
									trial. He secures not-guilty by intimidating the jury and visits Sherlock,
									explaining he still intends to "burn" him, taunting him with a "final problem" for
									him to solve. He also tries to destroy Sherlock's reputation. The two meet on the
									roof of a hospital, where Moriarty explains that assassins will kill John, Mrs.
									Hudson, and Lestrade if Sherlock does not commit suicide; he wants Sherlock to do
									this to cement his story after explaining that his "god code" was a myth. Moriarty
									kills himself to force Sherlock to do the same. Sherlock calls John, confesses to
									being a fraud, states his final "goodbye" and then steps off the roof.

									The police investigate a series of deaths related to people who all appear to have
									committed suicide by taking a poisonous pill. They turn to their unofficial
									consultant, Sherlock Holmes, who deduces various elements pointing to a serial
									killer. Meanwhile, Holmes is introduced to John Watson, a former soldier who served
									in Afghanistan, and the pair immediately move into a flat in Baker Street. John
									Watson slowly gets to know and trust Sherlock despite police officer Sally Donovan
									(Vinette Robinson) warning him that Holmes is a psychopath and will one day be
									responsible for murder. Sherlock's brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss), at first not
									revealing his identity, arranges a meeting with Watson and asks whether he will spy
									on Sherlock for money, but John refuses. After a series of incidents, the person
									responsible for the deaths, a taxicab driver (Phil Davis), reveals that his victims
									took their own lives by playing a game of Russian roulette with two pills: one
									fatally poisonous, the other safe. Before Sherlock can play the cabbie's game, John
									shoots the cabbie from an opposite building. Before he dies, the taxicab driver
									reveals that "Moriarty" was his sponsor.

									Sherlock is hired by an old friend to investigate a mysterious break-in at a bank in
									the City. He discovers that symbols spray-painted onto an office wall are a coded
									message intended for an employee of the bank, who is later discovered dead in his
									flat. The next day, a journalist is killed and the same symbols are found nearby.
									Sherlock and John follow a trail of clues that link the two dead men to a Chinese
									smuggling ring, who are trying to retrieve a valuable item that one of the dead men
									stole. Sherlock eventually cracks the coded message based on Suzhou numerals and a
									book cipher, but not before John and his date, Sarah, are kidnapped by the
									criminals, who believe that John is Sherlock. Sherlock rescues them, but the leader
									of the gang escapes. Later, the leader of the gang is in communication with her
									superior, who is identified by the initial "M". She is then shot by a sniper.

								<p id="season1Episode3Text">
									Sherlock is commissioned by Mycroft to investigate the suspicious death of a
									government employee, who was working on a top-secret defence project: the
									Bruce-Partington Project. After rejecting the case and handing it over to John,
									Sherlock begins to be taunted by a criminal who puts his victims into explosive
									vests and sets Sherlock deadlines to solve the apparently unrelated cases, which
									include a twenty-year-old cold case involving the shoes of a drowned boy, the
									disappearance of a businessman, the death of a TV personality, and the assassination
									of a museum security guard by the "Golem". As Sherlock solves the cases, he finds
									links between them. After clearing up the original case regarding the government
									employee, Sherlock tries to force his unseen adversary to reveal himself. Near the
									end of the episode, Sherlock and "Jim Moriarty" (Andrew Scott) reach a standoff,
									where Jim reveals that he is responsible for the crimes. In the final seconds,
									Sherlock Holmes points his gun at a bomb on the floor that had been strapped to
									John.
