			<h1>Brief</h1>
			<p>
				Arthur Conan Doyle began writing while studying medicine at university in the late 1870s, and had his
				first short story, "The Mystery of Sasassa Valley", published in September 1879. Eight years later his
				first Sherlock Holmes story, the novel A Study in Scarlet, was published by Ward Lock & Co. It was well
				received, but Doyle was paid little for it; after a sequel novel, The Sign of the Four, was published in
				Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, he shifted his focus to short stories. Soon after The Strand Magazine
				was inaugurated in January 1891, its editor Herbert Greenhough Smith received two submissions to the new
				monthly from Doyle. Later he described his reaction: "I at once realised that here was the greatest
				short story writer since Edgar Allan Poe." The first of them, "A Scandal in Bohemia", was published
				near the back of the July issue with ten illustrations by Sidney Paget. The stories proved popular,
				helping to boost the circulation of the magazine, and Doyle was paid 30 guineas each for the initial
				run of twelve. These first twelve stories were published monthly from July 1891 until June 1892,
				and then were collected together and published as a book, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 14
				October 1892 by George Newnes, the publisher of The Strand Magazine. The initial print run of the
				book was for 10,000 copies in the United Kingdom, and a further 4,500 copies in the United States, which
				were published by Harper Brothers the following day.

				Sidney Paget illustrated all twelve stories in The Strand and in the collection. The preceding Holmes
				novels had been illustrated by other artists.

				All of the stories within The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes are told in a first-person narrative from
				the point of view of Dr. Watson, as is the case for all but four of the Sherlock Holmes stories. The
				Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Doyle suggests that the short stories contained in The
				Adventures of Sherlock Holmes tend to point out social injustices, such as "a king's betrayal of an
				opera singer, a stepfather's deception of his ward as a fictitious lover, an aristocratic crook's
				exploitation of a failing pawnbroker, a beggar's extensive estate in Kent." It suggests that, in
				contrast, Holmes is portrayed as offering a fresh and fair approach in an unjust world of "official
				incompetence and aristocratic privilege". The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes contains many of Doyle's
				favourite Sherlock Holmes stories. In 1927, he submitted a list of what he believed were his twelve best
				Sherlock Holmes stories to The Strand Magazine. Among those he listed were "The Adventure of the
				Speckled Band" (as his favourite), "The Red-Headed League" (second), "A Scandal in Bohemia" (fifth) and
				"The Five Orange Pips" (seventh). The book was banned in the Soviet Union in 1929 because of its
				alleged "occultism", but the book gained popularity in a black market of similarly banned books, and
				the restriction was lifted in 1940.
