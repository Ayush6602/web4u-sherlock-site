						<p>
							Sherlock Holmes (born William Sherlock Scott Holmes) is the world's only consulting
							detective, a
							profession he created for himself. He is based in London and often consulted by Greg
							Lestrade of
							New Scotland Yard, usually taking his best friend and former flatmate, John Watson, on
							cases. He
							has a keen interest in unusual or bizarre crimes, without which he rapidly becomes
							bored,
							relying on nicotine to keep his brain active, although in the past he has dabbled in
							illegal
							drugs such as heroin for entertainment.

							Sherlock is a thinker and an observer; his incredible ability to notice and draw
							deductions
							from
							seemingly trivial details is his primary tool for solving crimes he investigates. He
							also
							often
							utilizes his "mind palace", a tool for remembering the smallest of details and visually
							organizing his memories. However, his unusual and somewhat anti-social personality has
							led
							to
							many in the official police force distrusting and disliking him. He also claims on more
							than
							one
							occasion to be a "high-functioning sociopath".

							Sherlock also has a blatant disregard for rules and etiquette. He once wore only a
							bedsheet
							to
							Buckingham Palace and was willing to walk out of there naked, greatly embarrassing
							Mycroft.

							Dr. John Hamish Watson (MBBS) is the best friend and assistant of Sherlock Holmes and a
							former
							British Army doctor. Before marrying Mary Morstan, he lived at 221B Baker Street with
							Sherlock,
							a flat they rented from Mrs Hudson. He lived with Mary, whom he worked with before
							developing a
							romantic relationship.

							John is extremely brave, resourceful and practical. He is extremely loyal to Sherlock,
							and
							will
							usually, but not always, do what Sherlock asks him to, and cares a great deal about his
							well-being. Sherlock likewise cares about John. He is also very selfless and modest, as
							he
							puts
							himself at colossal personal risks to help Sherlock Holmes and is rather sceptical about
							his
							companion's ideals. He is very sarcastic and has an erratic sense of humour.

							John deals with lack of stimulation little better than Sherlock does, the difference
							being
							that
							when Sherlock is bored he is very vocal in his frustration; when John feels that
							"nothing
							ever
							happens", he withdraws into a shell and shows strong tendencies towards depression
							(possibly
							exacerbated by his post-traumatic issues). He is adept at reading people through facial
							expressions, whilst Sherlock relies on his surroundings, on clothing and personality
							displays to
							read people.

						<p id="lestradeText">
							Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade is an inspector with New Scotland Yard. He often
							requires
							Sherlock Holmes' assistance to help with difficult cases. Greg has been affiliated with
							Sherlock
							for the better part of five years, but he still does not know everything about the
							consultant's
							antics and is therefore frequently surprised at his actions.

							Greg has respect for Sherlock and seems to possess none of the animosity his team has.
							He
							tries
							to get his team to cooperate with Sherlock whenever possible, even when Sherlock is
							being
							insulting. Despite this, he is often frustrated by Sherlock's cryptic deductions and
							lack of
							explanations for his conclusions, as well as his constant insults.

							When Jim Moriarty claims he will kill anyone Sherlock cares about, Greg is one of the
							three
							people Moriarty has identified as a friend of Sherlock's and therefore is a target. Greg
							does
							everything he can to help Sherlock and ignores the doubts planted by Moriarty. Sally
							Donovan
							forces him to consider Sherlock's implication in the crime and to present the case to
							the
							Chief
							Superintendent. He later phones John to warn him of Sherlock's imminent arrest, an act
							that
							could have gotten him fired or even thrown in jail.

					<div class="description-img-text">
						<span class="close hidden">&times;</span>
						<p id="mycroftText">
							Mycroft Holmes is Sherlock Holmes' brother and is traditionally older by seven years. It is
							mentioned in "The Final Problem" that, along with tradition, he remains seven years
							Sherlock's
							senior in the BBC adaption.

							Despite the hostility/rivalry he maintains toward Sherlock, Mycroft cares greatly for
							his
							brother, although his ways of watching out for his brother are unorthodox in the
							extreme. He is an almost entirely socially detached and calculating individual with an
							exceptional degree of self-control.

							Mycroft is shown to be much more capable of faking or maintaining a degree normalcy than
							his
							brother, whereas Sherlock is ostracized for his behaviour, Mycroft is highly respected
							by
							his
							peers. Though Mycroft is apparently just as cold as his brother, once informing him
							categorically that caring was not an advantage, he still strongly reacts to the loss of
							a
							human
							life.

							In tandem with his high intelligence, his self-confidence and mental resilience are
							almost
							inhuman, as he seems to be practically immune to even his own brother's probing and he
							was
							even
							able to resist Eurus own ability to instantly reprogram a person despite Eurus being
							more
							intelligent.

						<span class="close hidden">&times;</span>
						<p>
							James "Jim" Moriarty was the world's only "consulting criminal"; a stark contrast to his
							nemesis
							Sherlock Holmes' similarly unrivaled "consulting detective" occupation.

							A criminal genius, Jim Moriarty was a sadistic and psychopathic individual. He exhibited
							the
							following traits: extreme intelligence, grandiosity, incapacity for remorse, arrogance,
							and
							an
							unhealthy degree of self-confidence. He also displayed highly Machiavellian traits. Much
							like
							Sherlock, he had a sarcastic, cynical, albeit childish sense of humour but unlike
							Sherlock
							he
							often spoke in a tone that would intimidate or annoy his opponents.

							Moriarty believed his only weakness (or at least openly suggested it to be) that he was
							extremely changeable - this was prominently shown in him first deciding to abandon his
							showdown
							with Sherlock, only to abruptly return and threaten Sherlock again.

							Moriarty acted as a sponsor, an informant and a mastermind. He is shown to have an
							interest
							in
							Sherlock that borders on obsession, though he does not hesitate to try to kill him when
							he
							loses
							interest. In his operations, there is never any direct contact between Moriarty and his
							clients.

							Martha Louise Hudson (née Sissons) is the landlady of 221B and 221C Baker Street. She
							rents
							221B out to Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson. Mrs Hudson lives in the same building in
							a
							flat of her own.

							Sherlock won his way into her good graces after ensuring that her husband was executed
							for a
							double-murder in Florida. Due to his assistance, she allows Sherlock and John to have
							the
							flat
							at a lower cost than what it is worth. According to John, it is in a "prime location".

							Despite repeated declarations that she is not their housekeeper, she fusses over
							Sherlock
							and
							they share somewhat of a 'mother-son' relationship. Even Mycroft is far more casual than
							usual
							with her, and atypically flummoxed when he tells her to "for God's sake, shut up, Mrs
							Hudson!".

							She often assumes that John and Sherlock are a couple, despite John's constant
							proclamations
							on
							the topic.

							Mrs Hudson is kind and caring, and she looks after Sherlock and John despite insisting
							that
							she
							is their landlady, not their housekeeper.

							Molly Hooper is a specialist registrar in the morgue at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in
							London.
							Throughout most of the series, Molly has romantic feelings for Sherlock Holmes. Although
							he
							initially acts coldly to her, usually only exploiting these feelings to attain
							assistance or
							priveleges, Molly and Sherlock eventually develop a friendship as Molly grows confidence
							in
							herself and Sherlock realizes how much she means to him.

							After John refuses to solve crimes with Sherlock, Molly is asked to partner with him
							instead.
							While Molly initially feels awkward, Sherlock reassures her, saying that she only needs
							to
							be
							herself. At the end of their day together, Sherlock reveals he asked her to spend the
							day
							with
							him in order to thank her for her help in faking his death and invites her to dine with
							him
							that
							evening. Molly declines and explains she is engaged to Tom, her fiancé. Sherlock
							congratulates
							her on finally loving a man who is not a sociopath. This, because Sherlock has labelled
							himself
							a "sociopath" many times in the past, implies that he believes he himself is not a good
							match
							for her. Before the two go their separate ways, Sherlock wishes her the best in her new
							relationship, saying she "deserves to be happy."

							Mary Elizabeth Watson (formerly Morstan, born Rosamund Mary) is the identity used by a
							former
							assassin.

							She worked as a nurse in the same clinic as her husband John Watson, whom she met
							sometime
							after
							his best friend Sherlock Holmes' supposed death. She and John have a daughter named
							Rosamund
							Mary. She was killed by Vivian Norbury when trying to save Sherlock from being shot.

							Mary Morstan appeared to be a sweet, kind-hearted and lively person. She is very
							intelligent, as
							she was able to tell when Sherlock was lying and keep the secret of her past from him.
							She
							cared
							a great deal about John and Sherlock.

							Her relationship with John was threatened by the discovery that she was once an
							assassin.
							She
							has infrequently exhibited sociopathic tendencies, having a ruthless and violent side,
							as
							she
							was willing to murder Charles Augustus Magnussen in order to safeguard her secret from
							John.

							She was cunning and calculating, a tactical adept. She was also a markswoman, an
							excellent
							shot
							with small handguns, showing reflexes and perfect timing, able to shoot a hole in a
							fifty-pence
							coin when tossed in the air. She also had a photographic and extensive memory. She is
							also able to mimic different accents, such as a New York one.

						<p>
							Eurus Holmes is the younger sister of Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes who was completely
							unknown
							to
							Sherlock until her reveal in "The Lying Detective". She is the person behind Jim
							Moriarty's
							"Did
							You Miss Me?" propaganda.

							Eurus is extremely intelligent, and is a master of manipulation. As a young child, she
							lacked
							emotion and seemingly the ability to distinguish her own pain, cutting open her arm
							because
							she
							wanted to see how her muscles worked. Eurus lacks typical normal human feeling, but she
							watches
							and reads the emotional reactions and emotional states of others, manipulating them to
							her
							favour in order to better understand an individual.

							Despite her tormenting Sherlock, Eurus throughout her entire life held Sherlock as the
							only
							person who can reach her in her extreme feelings of isolation and psychosis, which he
							indeed
							finally solved decades later and managed to reach out to Eurus to reveal the location of
							the
							well she trapped Victor's remains and John in. While Eurus has shown little regard for
							human
							life, shown throughout the many people who died during her trials, she refused to let
							Sherlock
							die, shown when she tranquilized him to prevent him killing himself instead of John or
							Mycroft.
